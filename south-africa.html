                Queer students struggle with insufficient education on queer and trans issues, made
                worse by invalidation from their teachers.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-text">
                South Africa is applauded known for having a constitution which protects its people
                from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, something that
                the rest of the world tends to fall a bit short on. However, changing a policy is
                not the same thing as changing a system. These constitutional protections are often
                hard to utilize, because they are not explicit in their applications. For example,
                these protections extend to the workplace, but are not explicitly enforced in the
                education system. Although the constitution seems to support a queer- and trans-inclusive
                curriculum, it doesn't explicitly relate its protections to education, and is therefore
                unable to enforce such legislation. Unfortunately, this lack of specific language is
                often accompanied by a lack of knowledge about gender and sexuality (outside of the
                heteronormative sense), as well as an increasingly conservative and intolerant attitude
                towards such ideas.

                    The majority of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was enacted during apartheid, and
                    focuses on homosexuality in the public sphere. The most prominent example,
                    is the Immorality Act of 1957 which outlawed homosexuality. In response to
                    this, majority-white gay activist groups fought for equality with some small
                    victories. However, their lack of willingness to include people of color or
                    acknowledge the intersectionality with apartheid issues contributed to a
                    growing divide between black and white queer folks in South Africa. In 1996,
                    post-apartheid South Africa&#x2019;s new constitution made it illegal to discriminate
                    based on gender or sexual orientation. Later on, the Employment Equity Act 55
                    1998 extended these protections explicitly to the workplace. By 2006, 9 years
                    before the U.S., South Africa legalized same-sex marriage under the Union Bill.
                    Currently, although there are many vehemently opposing comprehensive
                    sex-education in schools, there is no significant anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in
                    these first few months of 2023.

                    Due to the lack of mandatory comprehensive sex-education curriculum in state
                    schools, there is little to no discussion of queer and trans topics in the
                    classroom. For example, the Life Orientation textbook sections on sexual health
                    rarely included non-heterosexual identities and practices, and when they did,
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681366.2021.1912159" target="_blank">80% of
                    the time</a> they were portrayed negatively. When you consider that
                    <a href="https://www.ru.ac.za/criticalstudies/latestnews/southafricaneducationandqueerstudents.html" target="_blank">between
                    1.5% and 10% of South Africa&#x2019;s youth identify as queer</a>, this lack
                    of a thorough education is even more concerning. Unfortunately, more than just
                    a mandate for more inclusive curriculums will be needed to truly ensure the
                    well-being of such students. Often, teacher&#x2019;s own beliefs, whether they
                    be based in religion or harmful stereotypes, enforce homophobia and
                    heteronormativity in the classroom. For example, a
                    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681366.2021.1912159" target="_blank">study</a>
                    of five trans students attending both state and private schools found that
                    teachers lecturing about sexuality education adhered to a binary understanding
                    of gender, and reinforced heteronormativity in their lessons. Both
                    misinformation be teachers and school routines which rely on the gender binary
                    can enforce heteronormativity to the point of instilling internalized
                    homophobia/transphobia within children. This means that even if they come to
                    terms with their own queerness/transness, the negativity expressed by others
                    might stay with them, and prohibit them from feeling valid themselves.

                    While again having its roots in the lack of a comprehensive sexual education
                    curriculum, this lack of information is at the point of erasure due to inaction.
                    While Life Orientation textbooks very rarely incorporated non-heterosexual
                    identities and practices, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681366.2021.1912159" target="_blank">same study</a>
                    as above finds that “representation of transgender identities is &#x2018;absent
                    completely&#x2019;, &#x2018;almost non-existent&#x2019; or &#x2018;erased&#x2019;.”
                    Additionally, issues of gender and sexuality are limited primarily to the Life
                    Orientation class taken in secondary school, and so broader explanations of
                    these concepts (outside of reproductive health) are almost nonexistent. Teachers
                    often rely on a binary understanding of gender, and rarely understand the
                    difference between sex and gender. Even those who would be open to teaching on
                    such topics often have a lack of understanding of the matters, and if they do
                    attempt to teach them anyway, could promote harmful stereotypes that erase the
                    diversity of queer and trans identities. Worse than all of this is that it is
                    not uncommon for teachers to blatantly invalidate students&#x2019; identities, often
                    in front of the entire class. According to Sam, a grade 12 trans boy at a
                    private school, his teacher “insists on calling me by my dead name . . . will
                    misgender me and then laugh. He will say loudly in front of the other learners
                    when referring to me &#x2013; &#x2018;tell him, her or whatever&#x2019;.” At least 4 out of the 5
                    students interviewed for the above study experienced similar things. Not only
                    do teachers participate in the erasure of queer and trans identities from
                    education, but they also attempt to erase these identities from their classrooms
                    by invalidating their own students.

                    In August of 2022, <a href=”https://www.mambaonline.com/2022/08/22/family-mourns-loss-of-soweto-gay-teen-bullied-by-teacher/” target=”_blank”>Tiro Moalusi</a>,
                    a 15-year-old student from Soweto took his own life after being humiliated by
                    a student teacher because of his sexuality. The same month, 14-year-old
                    <a href=”https://www.mambaonline.com/2022/08/26/open-letter-minister-motshekga-must-make-schools-safe-for-queer-youth/” target=”_blank”>Lukhanyo Jongqo</a>
                    committed suicide after being bullied. The same thing happened only two months
                    before to a 14-year-old named <a href=”https://www.mambaonline.com/2022/06/10/bullied-gay-14-year-old-takes-his-own-life/” target=”_blank”>Mpho Falithenjwa</a>
                    in Orange Farm. Without mandatory inclusion of topics like gender and sexuality
                    in school curriculums, there is no consistent support for queer and trans folks
                    in South African schools. Schools, especially those which were formerly
                    Christian schools, have even been known to punish students who act outside of
                    the bounds of heteronormativity. For diverse and well-off cities like Western
                    Cape and Gauteng, youth have access to well-established support groups in the
                    local area. However, those outside of these locations have to rely on school
                    clubs and support groups which are even more few and far between. The lack of
                    legislation requiring support of queer and trans students in South African
                    schools leaves the possibility of resources for these students largely up to
                    chance, something that cannot continue unless schools want to lose more of
                    their students.
