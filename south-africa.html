                        The majority of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was enacted during apartheid, and
                        focuses on homosexuality in the public sphere. The most prominent example,
                        is the Immorality Act of 1957 which outlawed homosexuality. In response to
                        this, majority-white gay activist groups fought for equality with some small
                        victories. However, their lack of willingness to include people of color or
                        acknowledge the intersectionality with apartheid issues contributed to a
                        growing divide between black and white queer folks in South Africa. In 1996,
                        post-apartheid South Africa&#x2019;s new constitution made it illegal to discriminate
                        based on gender or sexual orientation. Later on, the Employment Equity Act 55
                        1998 extended these protections explicitly to the workplace. By 2006, 9 years
                        before the U.S., South Africa legalized same-sex marriage under the Union Bill.
                        Currently, although there are many vehemently opposing comprehensive
                        sex-education in schools, there is no significant anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in
                        these first few months of 2023.

                    <h2 class="section-title">In the Classroom</h2>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        Due to the lack of mandatory comprehensive sex-education curriculum in state
                        schools, there is little to no discussion of queer and trans topics in the
                        classroom. For example, the Life Orientation textbook sections on sexual health
                        rarely included non-heterosexual identities and practices, and when they did,
                        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681366.2021.1912159" target="_blank">80% of
                        the time</a> they were portrayed negatively. When you consider that
                        <a href="https://www.ru.ac.za/criticalstudies/latestnews/southafricaneducationandqueerstudents.html" target="_blank">between
                        1.5% and 10% of South Africa&#x2019;s youth identify as queer</a>, this lack
                        of a thorough education is even more concerning. Unfortunately, more than just
                        a mandate for more inclusive curriculums will be needed to truly ensure the
                        well-being of such students. Often, teacher&#x2019;s own beliefs, whether they
                        be based in religion or harmful stereotypes, enforce homophobia and
                        heteronormativity in the classroom. For example, a
                        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681366.2021.1912159" target="_blank">study</a>
                        of five trans students attending both state and private schools found that
                        teachers lecturing about sexuality education adhered to a binary understanding
                        of gender, and reinforced heteronormativity in their lessons. Both
                        misinformation be teachers and school routines which rely on the gender binary
                        can enforce heteronormativity to the point of instilling internalized
                        homophobia/transphobia within children. This means that even if they come to
                        terms with their own queerness/transness, the negativity expressed by others
                        might stay with them, and prohibit them from feeling valid themselves.

                    <h2 class="section-title">Queer &amp; Trans Erasure</h2>
                    <p class="section-text">
                        While again having its roots in the lack of a comprehensive sexual education
                        curriculum, this lack of information is at the point of erasure due to inaction.
                        While Life Orientation textbooks very rarely incorporated non-heterosexual
                        identities and practices, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681366.2021.1912159" target="_blank">same study</a>
                        as above finds that “representation of transgender identities is &#x2018;absent
                        completely&#x2019;, &#x2018;almost non-existent&#x2019; or &#x2018;erased&#x2019;.”
                        Additionally, issues of gender and sexuality are limited primarily to the Life
                        Orientation class taken in secondary school, and so broader explanations of
                        these concepts (outside of reproductive health) are almost nonexistent. Teachers
                        often rely on a binary understanding of gender, and rarely understand the
                        difference between sex and gender. Even those who would be open to teaching on
                        such topics often have a lack of understanding of the matters, and if they do
                        attempt to teach them anyway, could promote harmful stereotypes that erase the
                        diversity of queer and trans identities. Worse than all of this is that it is
                        not uncommon for teachers to blatantly invalidate students&#x2019; identities, often
                        in front of the entire class. According to Sam, a grade 12 trans boy at a
                        private school, his teacher “insists on calling me by my dead name . . . will
                        misgender me and then laugh. He will say loudly in front of the other learners
                        when referring to me &#x2013; &#x2018;tell him, her or whatever&#x2019;.” At least 4 out of the 5
                        students interviewed for the above study experienced similar things. Not only
                        do teachers participate in the erasure of queer and trans identities from
                        education, but they also attempt to erase these identities from their classrooms
                        by invalidating their own students.

                        Soweto took his own life after being humiliated by a student teacher because
                        of his sexuality. The same month, 14-year-old

                        committed suicide after being bullied. The same thing happened only two months
                        before to a 14-year-old named <a href=”https://www.mambaonline.com/2022/06/10/bullied-gay-14-year-old-takes-his-own-life/” target=”_blank”>Mpho Falithenjwa</a>
                        in Orange Farm. Without mandatory inclusion of topics like gender and sexuality
                        in school curriculums, there is no consistent support for queer and trans folks
                        in South African schools. Schools, especially those which were formerly
                        Christian schools, have even been known to punish students who act outside of
                        the bounds of heteronormativity. For diverse and well-off cities like Western
                        Cape and Gauteng, youth have access to well-established support groups in the
                        local area. However, those outside of these locations have to rely on school
                        clubs and support groups which are even more few and far between. The lack of
                        legislation requiring support of queer and trans students in South African
                        schools leaves the possibility of resources for these students largely up to
                        chance, something that cannot continue unless schools want to lose more of
                        their students.
