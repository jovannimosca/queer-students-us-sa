                Current efforts to discriminate against queer and trans folks in the U.S. centers
                around education, drawing parallels to other times in U.S. history such as the
                civil rights movement, where schools became a battleground for equality. Beyond a
                thorough understanding of the anti-LGBTQ+ legislation that we are facing today, it
                is also important to understand the broader impacts that such legislation would
                have. Not only does this legislation harm queer students, but it also harms
                broader communities as well by decreasing diversity, increasing the possibility of
                further discriminatory legislation, and negatively impacting public health.

                    We are seeing a frightening pattern of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation aimed towards
                    the realm of education within the past few years. Aside from the 311
                    currently-proposed bills, the most prominent anti-queer legislation has most
                    definitely been Florida&#x2019;s HB 1557, known was the “Don&#x2019;t Say Gay” law. This
                    law prevents teachers from discussing topics regarding sexual orientation
                    and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade. This means that
                    not only are such subjects barred from classrooms, but teachers are are also
                    prohibited from discussing these matters with students who ask for support
                    outside of class times. Even more frightening, these laws which currently
                    only target queer folks in education become a form of sanctioned
                    discrimination. The passage of these laws therefore sets a precedent for
                    such discrimination, and makes it foreseeable that such legislation might
                    spread to other aspects of life as well.

                    A school curriculum is a statement of what topics are important to learn,
                    and what are not. The subjects that are taught go even further, regarding
                    some knowledges as more valuable than others based on what is or isn&#x2019;t
                    taught. In this way, bias runs rampant in our education systems. When school
                    districts and governments decide to restrict when and what forms of LGBTQ+
                    topics are taught, this sends a very clear message on what they deem as more
                    important (usually the cis-heteronormative option). When schools do include
                    topics on queer and trans issues, they can still do great harm to those
                    students. There is, of course, the risk of provoking bullying within the
                    classroom. However, even a classroom which ensures tolerance and fosters
                    open discussion, can still cause harm. For example, a
                    <a href=”https://doi.org/10.1108/ETPC-04-2022-0054” target="_blank">yearlong study</a> at a
                    midwestern high school of a well-structured and well-intended English
                    class, found that queer and trans students in the class were tokenized as
                    representatives of their identity, and in turn, dehumanized as resources for
                    reason rather than real people.

                    The focus of anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and policy on education is especially
                    frightening, and could even be considered an attempt to erase queer folks
                    from history. Recently, these policies have even included
                    <a href=”https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/book-bans-dont-say-gay-bill-lgbtq-kids-feel-erased-classroom-rcna15819” target="_blank">“book bans”</a>
                    attempting to remove books from schools which depict queer and trans folks,
                    especially children and young adults. These policies often take the guise
                    of protecting children from sexually explicit or graphic content, or exposure
                    to highly politicized issues. Beyond books,
                    <a href=”https://www.glsen.org/sites/default/files/2019-10/GLSEN-Research-Laws-that-Prohibit-Promotion-of-Homosexuality-Implications.pdf” target="_blank">laws at the state level</a>
                    in states like Alabama, Arizona, and Louisiana explicitly prohibit the
                    “promotion” of homosexuality in schools. Some even mandate that sexual health
                    education inform students that it is not an acceptable or sustainable
                    “lifestyle”. Laws like these legally require queer erasure, sometimes even
                    utilizing the position of teachers to enforce students conform to
                    heteronormativity - meaning that they should be and act “straight”.

                    With differences in state laws and school curriculums, not all schools have
                    a comprehensive sexual education, or any education on queer and trans issues
                    at all. It is in these schools especially where clubs and student organizations
                    are an integral part of the support system for LGBTQ+ students. In some cases
                    they are an oasis for emotional support, reminding students that there is
                    nothing wrong with them, and that they are not struggling alone. In other
                    cases, these groups even act as supplementary education, discussing queer
                    sex-ed and the history of queerness and gender-diversity. For Makayla Brown,
                    a 14-year-old queer and nonbinary black artist at a Florida high school, the
                    school&#x2019;s READI (Rainbow Education Alliance for Diverse Individuals) club is a
                    safe space where queer and trans students can learn about their identities and
                    connect with their communities. Beyond academic and professional development,
                    they say that when they joined the club, “It felt nice to finally have a space
                    to be myself around people who would listen and understand me.”. Read more about

                    An <a href=”https://doi.org/10.1007/s13178-022-00773-0” target="_blank">article</a> published
                    in the November edition of the journal of Sexuality Research and Social Policy
                    examines the connection between anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and public health,
                    especially as it relates to education and the U.S. public school system. One
                    of the most obvious connections between these laws and public health, is their
                    potential to increase chronic stress of queer folks, especially at the
                    intersection of race and queerness. A prolonged increase in stress such as this
                    could increase the likelihood of stress-induced conditions such as
                    cardiovascular disease and hypertension, and contribute to other such as high
                    blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. In addition, this pushes queer folks
                    towards the use of substances to combat this stress and anxiety, and can
                    encourage these already risky behaviors.
