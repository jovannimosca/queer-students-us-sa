                    <p class="section-text">
                        We are seeing a frightening pattern of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation aimed towards the
                        realm of education within the past few years. Aside from the 299 currently-proposed
                        bills, the most prominent anti-queer legislation has most definitely been Florida&#x2019;s
                        HB 1557, known was the “Don&#x2019;t Say Gay” law. This law prevents teachers from discussing
                        topics regarding sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through
                        third grade. This means that not only are such subjects barred from classrooms, but
                        teachers are are also prohibited from discussing these matters with students who ask
                        for support outside of class times. Even more frightening, these laws which currently
                        only target queer folks in education become a form of sanctioned discrimination. The
                        passage of these laws therefore sets a precedent for such discrimination, and makes
                        it foreseeable that such legislation might spread to other aspects of life as well.

                    <p class="section-text">
                        An article published in the November edition of the journal of Sexuality Research
                        and Social Policy examines the connection between anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and public
                        health, especially as it relates to education and the U.S. public school system.
                        One of the most obvious connections between these laws and public health, is their
                        potential to increase chronic stress of queer folks, especially at the intersection
                        of race and queerness. A prolonged increase in stress such as this could increase
                        the likelihood of stress-induced conditions such as cardiovascular disease and
                        hypertension, and contribute to other such as high blood pressure, heart disease,
                        and stroke. In addition, this pushes queer folks towards the use of substances to
                        combat this stress and anxiety, and can encourage these already risky behaviors.
