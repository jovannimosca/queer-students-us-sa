                While queer and trans students in the U.S. and South Africa are facing difficult
                issues at the moment, it is important to remember that these issues are not without
                remedies. Here, you will find explanations of how we might address these issues.
                There is no single way to combat homophobia and transphobia, but the recommendations
                below may serve as a starting point for more brainstorming and further research & planning.
                If you would like more information on actionable approaches or how to get involved,

                    An important facet of combatting anti-LGBTQ+ legislation is activism. This
                    doesn&apos;t have to mean participating in protests or rallying opposition to
                    discriminatory legislation. In cases like these where issues are so completely
                    politicized and therefore polarized, taking activism to the local and even district
                    level is an important part of combatting such legislation. It is especially
                    important that we tackle the latest legislation in the U.S. regarding the teaching
                    of queer and trans concepts in schools, so that it does not set a precedent for
                    sanctioned discrimination in the U.S.

                <p class="card-contents">
                    It is important to create a classroom environment where all students feel safe
                    to express themselves and be involved in discussions regarding identity. However,
                    this classroom environment is not created just through the LGBTQ+ inclusive
                    curriculums. It is firstly the role of teachers to ensure the safety of all
                    students in their classes, and to respect students&apos; identities. Teachers
                    must also be careful to stress the diversity of queer and trans identities. While
                    ensuring that queer and trans students are respected as knowledgeable and valid,
                    they must also be careful not to allow these students to be perceived as monolithic
                    representations of such an identity. Teachers must also ensure that students who
                    become representatives of their own identity in discussion do not become
                    unintentionally dehumanized by their classmates.

                    <h2 class="card-title">Queer &amp; Trans Erasure</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="card-contents">
                    The first and most obvious way to combat queer and trans erasure, is to ensure
                    that an inclusive curriculum is available in schools. This means that we must
                    prevent legislation which sanctions such discrimination against curricula suitable
                    for primary and secondary school students. We must also combat conservative claims
                    that such curricula are &#x2018;inappropriate&#x2019; and work against students&apos;
                    freedom of religion. Additionally, and similarly to the topic of queer and trans
                    inclusivity in the classroom, we must ensure that teachers and school staff are
                    not invalidating the identities of their students. We must offer better training
                    on queer and trans issues for teachers, so that they know how to support such
                    students, or at the very least, how to treat them with respect.

                    <h2 class="card-title">Support Systems</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="card-contents">
                    Schools, especially those in areas lacking external resources for queer and trans
                    students, should attempt to facilitate these support systems on their campuses.
                    This could mean having one or two teachers facilitate the creation of a club for
                    LGBTQ+ students, or simply educating school advisors and counselors on such issues
                    so that they can support students in one-on-one scenarios. Supporting students
                    must also involve adequately educating them on the subjects of gender and sexuality,
                    but the staggering opposition that we are seeing today suggests that a more
                    effective strategy for education at the moment would be to integrate this education
                    into voluntary classes or clubs.
