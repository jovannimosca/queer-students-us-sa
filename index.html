                    As a queer student in primary or secondary school, you already have
                    enough to deal with in terms of understanding your own identity, resisting
                    the pressures of society, and dealing with the harassment of school
                    bullies. This is all more than enough without adding to it an education
                    that is designed to isolate LGBTQ+ students, and teachers that pressure
                    them to conform. Unfortunately, this is exactly what many students across
                    the world have to deal with every day.

                        Although South Africa&#x2019;s constitution explicitly protects against discrimination
                        on the basis of gender and sexual orientation, these protections are not
                        described in a way that makes them easily applicable to education. Even in 2023,
                        state school curriculums, even for classes like Life Orientation, are not
                        mandated to include discussions of diverse genders and sexualities, and so many
                        do not. The situation is even more bleak in township schools, where school
                        officials fear upsetting parents and communities overall. On top of all this,
                        conservative groups are <a href="https://theconversation.com/americas-right-is-lobbying-against-south-africas-sex-education-syllabus-126356" target="_blank">challenging
                        any and all attempts</a> at a comprehensive sexual-education curriculum, some
                        of which have extensive ties to the U.S. from which they model their initiatives:

                        In the past few decades, the U.S. has seen various pieces of
                        legislation in support of queer folks as a whole. In June of 2006,
                        the Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas officially repealed sodomy
                        laws in the U.S., decriminalizing homosexuality at the federal
                        level for the first time. In 2015, we saw the court case of Obergefell
                        v. Hodges which legalized same-sex marriage at the federal level.
                        However, this slow but steady improvement has taken a turn for the
                        worst in the past several years, specifically in the area of education.
                        Just a little over a month into the 2023 legislative session, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/" target="_blank">American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</a>
                        is already tracking more than <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights" target="_blank">
                        300 anti-queer bills</a> like the following:
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        <strong>SB 141 (Georgia):</strong> requires school nurses to alert a
                        student&#x2019;s parent(s) if the student expresses gender dysphoria.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A 630 (New Jersey):</strong> requires school sports teams to be categorized
                        by biological sex, and student athletes whose “sex is disputed” to provide a
                        doctor&#x2019;s note establishing their sex on the basis of genitalia,
                        testosterone levels, and genetic makeup.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>SB 1001 (Arizona):</strong> states that school officials may
                        not address a student by their preferred pronouns if those pronouns
                        differ from those associated with the student&#x2019;s biological sex,
                        without written consent from the parent.

            <h2>Comparison</h2>
            <p>Let's explore what connects us:</p>
            <li>
                <strong>Constitutional Protections:</strong> South Africa is more inclusive than the U.S.
                because it included protections from discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation
                and gender identity from its creation. Legal protections against discrimination based
                on these characteristics was not established in the U.S. until June of 2020, when the
                Supreme Court ruled that sexual orientation and gender identity were to be considered
                part of discrimination based on "sex", which is protected by Title VII of the Civil
                Rights Act of 1964.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>School Curriculums:</strong> at this moment in time, both the U.S. and South
                Africa are seeing major opposition to proposals for a more comprehensive sexual
                education curriculum which includes topics of gender identity and sexual orientation.
                This opposition comes from far-right groups in both countries, who make claims under
                the guise of 'freedom of religion', 'parental rights', and 'family values'. In the U.S.
                this means a shocking number of anti-LGBTQ+ bills being proposed to ensure that these
                topics are not taught. In South Africa, this means there has been little to no effort
                to establish such a curricula in the majority of the country.
